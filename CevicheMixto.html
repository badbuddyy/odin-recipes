        Nothing makes me happier than having a tasty Peruvian ceviche mixto with sweet potato. At home, making Peruvian ceviche is synonymous with having fun. Now that you can easily get many of the ingredients in the U.S. I could not pass up the opportunity to use “choclo”, Peruvian corn. Many people like to add milk to the ceviche, but I prefer not to. I hope you enjoy this tasty and easy recipe for Peruvian ceviche mixto, and that you enjoy it as much as I do.
